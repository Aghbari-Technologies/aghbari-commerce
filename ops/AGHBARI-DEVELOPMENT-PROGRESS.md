# 🔴 AGHBARI DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS — CANONICAL LIVE LEDGER

## Run 2026-09-23 — Exact-head reconciliation + UI/core frontier audit

### Baseline
- Repository: Aghbari-Technologies/aghbari-commerce
- Actual verified Git HEAD at start: `c249f4ec9930d7007e4efd35bdefea0acf9c9e5a`
- Branch: `main`
- Production: NO TOUCH
- Certification: NOT CLAIMED

### Root cause / reality correction
The live-state document was intentionally carrying an older “last verified working HEAD” (`e80c432...`) while the repository had advanced through documentation-control commits to `c249f4e...`. The execution protocol requires current repository state to override historical state.

### Verified implementation frontier
- Runtime entry currently uses `src/AppV3Fixed.tsx`; staff users are routed into `AdminPanel`.
- Customer portal currently has authenticated catalog/search/category filtering, authorized customer pricing, inventory visibility, cart persistence, quantity confirmation, checkout, orders, templates, finance/ledger export, quick SKU ordering and Excel quick-order staging.
- Admin currently exposes executive dashboard, orders/workflow, products/categories/pricing/media, secure import, inventory, customers, purchasing, finance, export and client UI controls.
- The service/domain layer and Supabase migration/test tree contain the established transactional, RLS, RPC, outbox, idempotency and concurrency foundations.

### Open UI gaps identified for next implementation frontier
1. Customer order-detail view with real line-item persistence and explicit status timeline/tracking.
2. Customer account/profile surface with organization/customer context and session controls.
3. Admin command-center navigation should expose all existing operational sections rather than only the primary seven anchors.
4. Customer portal should expose explicit loading/empty/error/retry and responsive states per major sub-view, then receive exact-SHA browser proof.

### Open core/proof gaps
1. Reconcile exact current database/runtime evidence against `c249f4e...`; no production claim.
2. Re-run exact-head application quality, browser and security workflows after the next code change.
3. Complete semantic merge/reference audit of the 50 historical Markdown sources before retirement; the current canonical docs are still compact authority summaries, not proof of 50/50 semantic merge.

### Decision
Do not restart from historical branches or repeat already proven transactional/security work without an invalidation reason. The next code frontier is the customer order/account experience plus admin navigation, while exact-SHA CI/browser/security evidence is run against the resulting HEAD.
