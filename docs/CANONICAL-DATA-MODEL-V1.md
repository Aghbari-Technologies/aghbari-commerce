# Aghbari — Canonical Operational Data Model V1

**Status:** Phase-0 candidate baseline; implementation begins only after Batch-3 reconciliation.

## 1. Ownership rule
Each business fact has one canonical owner. Derived views, caches, exports, and Report-Advisor datasets never become competing sources of truth.

## 2. Core identity and scope
- organizations/tenants
- branches
- warehouses
- users
- roles / role assignments
- customers
- suppliers

All scoped records carry the minimum required ownership/scope keys and immutable primary identity.

## 3. Catalog
- categories
- products
- product media
- product identifiers (SKU/barcode/item number)
- units
- product status

Product identity is stable. Presentation/media can evolve without changing the canonical product identity.

## 4. Pricing
- customer pricing tiers
- product prices by tier
- effective dates/versioning where required
- price change audit
- optional approved promotion/discount rules

Customer-facing reads resolve one authorized price. Alternative tiers are never exposed through the customer contract.

## 5. Inventory
- inventory balances by warehouse/product
- inventory movements
- stock adjustment records
- thresholds
- reservations where required by the order lifecycle

Balance is a transactional projection supported by a movement ledger. Every material mutation has actor, reason, source/reference, and timestamp.

## 6. Sales
- orders
- order lines
- order status history
- order notes
- invoices/operational invoice snapshots where needed
- customer/order delivery records

An order has one canonical identity and immutable audit provenance. Lines reference canonical products and preserve the price/quantity actually committed to the order.

## 7. Purchasing
- purchase orders
- purchase lines
- receiving events
- supplier references

Purchasing changes inventory through explicit transactional domain operations, never ad-hoc direct balance edits.

## 8. Promotions
Promotions are a separate bounded context from base pricing. Eligibility and precedence must be deterministic. The resulting authorized sell price is resolved server-side and recorded in the transaction when financially material.

## 9. Notifications
- notification intent/event
- recipient
- channel
- delivery state
- attempts
- provider reference

Notifications are side effects and never block the canonical order transaction.

## 10. Integration/outbox
- durable outbox events
- delivery attempts
- integration providers/adapters
- idempotency keys
- correlation IDs
- retry/dead-letter state

External system state is stored as integration evidence, not treated as canonical internal business truth.

## 11. Import/export
Imports use:
`upload → quarantine → parse → schema validation → business validation → preview → commit transaction → result/evidence`.

Exports are generated from authorized canonical reads and are versioned by contract where external systems depend on exact columns.

## 12. Audit and security
Audit records cover sensitive business and security actions. They must be append-oriented, tamper-resistant at the application level, scope-aware, and free of secrets.

## 13. Concurrency invariants
1. Order creation is idempotent by client operation key.
2. Inventory mutation is atomic.
3. Stock reservation/release cannot double-apply.
4. A product added repeatedly to a cart resolves to one logical line per cart/product combination.
5. Price resolution is deterministic for the transaction context.
6. State transitions reject invalid/stale transitions.
7. External retries cannot duplicate internal business mutations.
8. Unique order numbers are generated server-side.
9. Soft deletion cannot bypass security or uniqueness invariants.

## 14. Financial integrity
Never trust client-calculated totals as canonical. Server-side calculation uses the authorized price, quantity, discounts, taxes/fees if enabled, and rounding policy. The committed transaction stores sufficient snapshot information to reproduce the operational invoice.

## 15. Report-Advisor boundary
Operational facts originate here. Analytical projections may be exported/published through a controlled bridge to Report-Advisor. Report-Advisor calculations must not write competing operational truth back into core tables.

## 16. Migration principle
Schema changes are forward, reviewable, repeatable, and testable. Destructive changes require an explicit migration plan, backup/recovery consideration, compatibility window where needed, and evidence.

## 17. V1 decision
Use a normalized transactional core with explicit bounded-context ownership, immutable identifiers, auditable movements/events, transactional projections, and adapter boundaries. Exact physical table names/indexes await final Batch-3 reconciliation and technology freeze.
