# Aghbari Commerce — Execution Log 2026-09-08

**Scope:** `Aghbari-Technologies/aghbari-commerce` only.

## Completed in this execution cycle

### GitHub source
- PR #42 (`security/rpc-surface-final6`) was reviewed and merged into `main` with exact head `46f1a77689a7e05409b404ef79e0b97078450bfe`.
- The merge brought the warehouse-aware catalog boundary, legacy catalog RPC lockdown, authenticated application RPC restoration, expanded database security tests, and adversarial client-input regressions into `main`.
- Current source HEAD after the first release-hardening commit: `02285b7c12a0b9310f3e0ca45b097b1bb43dd6c4`.
- The lockfile bootstrap workflow was hardened so a failed `npm install --package-lock-only` captures its full npm output as a GitHub Actions artifact instead of failing without usable diagnostics.

### Database / Supabase
- Live target verified as the Aghbari Commerce Supabase project `mrcyqezbhpncuvaehwgf`.
- Live migration history currently contains the operational schema through the `0062_fix_receive_purchase_order_status_enum` change set.
- Public schema currently contains 34 tables and all 34 have RLS enabled.
- Public RPC inspection confirms the application mutation/read surface is authenticated-only; the legacy 4-argument `get_catalog` is not executable by authenticated or anonymous roles.
- Live negative authorization smoke checks with a synthetic authenticated identity returned no organization/customer context and rejected unauthorized catalog/order execution paths.
- Live data counts for organizations, customers, products, orders, purchase orders, invoices, outbox events, and audit events are all zero; no temporary test fixtures were left behind.
- The Supabase performance advisor's previous unindexed-FK findings were eliminated by adding 25 covering indexes for the affected composite and organization foreign keys.
- The performance advisor now reports only unused-index informational notices; with the database empty, these are not treated as defects and no indexes were removed solely because they have not yet been used.

## Important remaining certification gates

1. `package-lock.json` still needs to be generated and committed by a successful runner; source inspection confirms it was absent before the bootstrap workflow repair.
2. Fresh GitHub Actions execution evidence must be obtained for the current exact HEAD. Existing historical failures expose no job steps/log payload, so they cannot be converted into a code-level PASS/FAIL diagnosis.
3. Fresh typecheck, lint, unit/domain, PostgreSQL/pgTAP, build, and release-audit execution must be observed on the exact current HEAD.
4. Authenticated browser E2E requires real staging identities and a reachable application environment.
5. Production deployment/runtime smoke tests and external outbox delivery remain to be proven.
6. Final certification remains blocked until the runtime and runner evidence gates are green.

**Certification rule:** source implementation and live database evidence are recorded separately from runtime certification. No production certification is claimed by this log.
